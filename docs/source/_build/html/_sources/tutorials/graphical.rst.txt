Graphical output
================

* When a :code:`run` or :code:`to_taxonomy` command is executed, raw summary files are produced (as described in :doc:`Classification <classify>`) and a phylotree is also produced as a graphical depiction of the sample summary.
* This graphical representation has some customisable features:
  
  * Multiple samples can be plotted on the same tree, with different colours for different samples.
  * Sample results can be grouped together to appear as one on the tree.

* Shown below is an example graphical output.
* If no colours are supplied (*see below*), a random colour is chosen for each sample.
* Colours are shaded based on how prevalent any given clade is.

* One tree is produced for each type of results - *complete* classifications and *splits*.

Features and CLI
---------------------------

.. raw:: html

    <hr>

.. role:: redbackground

:redbackground:`Sample names in the following refer to the original input file without any sequence or compression file extensions.`

For instance, :code:`sample_one.fq.tar.gz` :math:`\rightarrow` :code:`sample_one`.

Groups
^^^^^^

.. option:: --group <hex_colour (optional)> <sample_one> <sample_two> ...

    Group together classifications in samples :code:`sample_one`, :code:`sample_two` and so on. **This is done both in
    sample summary files, and on the ouptut phylotree.**

    Optionally, a hex colour string can be supplied just after the :code:`--group` flag to assign a colour to this group.

.. warning:: 

    When specifying a colour for each group, this should be enclosed in quotation marks. Otherwise, the command line
    will treat the rest of the command as a comment (and be ignored).

Example of grouping
"""""""""""""""""""

* Say we have six samples to be profiled and grouped - :code:`a1`, :code:`a2`, :code:`a3`, :code:`b1`, :code:`b2`, :code:`b3`.

.. code-block:: console

    $ expam run ... --group a1 a2 a3 --group b1 b2 b3
    $ expam run ... --group "#FF0000" a1 a2 a3 --group "#00FF00" b1 b2 b3

.. note:: 

    In the sample summary files, the combined groups will be referred to by the first member specified in the group (without file extensions).

.. note:: 
    On paired-end data.

    When grouping paired-end data, **only refer to the alphabetically smaller sample name when declaring group members**. 

    Say we are grouping 
    
      * :code:`a1_f.fq`, :code:`a1_r.fq`, :code:`a2_f.fq`, :code:`a2_r.fq`,
      * :code:`b1_f.fq`, :code:`b1_r.fq`, :code:`b2_f.fq`, :code:`b2_r.fq`.

    We could do so through

    .. code-block:: console

        $ expam run ... --paired --group a1_f a2_f --group b1_f b2_f

Visual flags
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. option:: --phyla

    Colour the perimeter of the tree with colours associated with the four main bacterial phyla 
    (Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria).

.. option:: --ignore_names

    Do not add reference genome names to the perimeter of the phylotree.

.. option:: --colour_list

    Instead of randomly assigning colours to each sample, you can supply a list of colours, which will be taken in the supplied order.

    .. note::

        If both :code:`--colour_list` and a colour declared with the group are supplied, the colour declared next to :code:`--group`
        is given priority.

Example of colour list
""""""""""""""""""""""

.. code-block:: console

    $ expam run ... --colour_list "#FF0000" "#00FF00" "#0000FF"
